The function getChar() checks if the size of the inputBuffer is not 0, 
otherwise any character can be read from the buffer. If the size is greater
than 0 the function reads the first character calling the function 
bufferRead() and returns the value read. Otherwise the task is enqueued in
the waiting queue for the reading tasks.

The function putChar() checks if the size of the outputBuffer is not 
BUFFER_SIZE, so checks if the outputBuffer is not full. If the buffer is    
not full, the function writes the value passed as argument in the outputBuffer
calling the function bufferWrite. Otherwise the task is enqueued in
the waiting queue for the writing tasks.
